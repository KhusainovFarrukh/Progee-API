## Description

Hi! This is **Progee-API v1**. 
Progee-API is a REST API for providing information about programming languages, and frameworks, their popularity, and respect for them among the community of developers (with reviews and scores). 
Currently working features: **auth, languages, frameworks, reviews**.

## API docs

Documentation for the Progee API is available at Postman Documenter: [See docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14256972/UzBgwAPQ)

Progee API is currently deployed and working. Base url is: https://progee-api-v1.herokuapp.com (See API docs above to understand where to use base-url)

## Database relations map

Progee API includes 4 main entities: Language (for programming language), Framework (for framework of programming language), AppUser (for user of application) and Review (users' review about programming language).
And here is relations between tables of PostgreSQL database:

## Frontend (Android client)

Currently, there is Android client app for testing Progee-API main features. Progee-Android is in alpha state now. See [GitHub repository of Progee-Android](https://github.com/khusainovfarrukh/progee-android) for additional information

## Tech stack

This REST API is developed using Java programming language and Spring Boot starter of Spring framework. The full tech stack:

  - **Spring Boot**
  - **PostgreSQL** for Database
  - **Spring Data JPA** for data access layers
  - **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization
  - **JWT** for tokens and share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server
  - **JUnit 5** for unit and integration tests
  - **Jakarta Validation API** for expressing and validating application constraints
  - **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code
  - and etc.

## Usage

**Attention!** This project uses IntelliJ IDEA environment variables for some configuration properties (secret key of HMAC256 algorithm used to encode/decode JWT token). Define your environment variables or paste your values directly to places where environment variables are used:

- System.getenv("MY_JWT_SECRET") at JWTUtils: line 34
