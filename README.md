## Description

Hi! This is **Progee-API v1**. 
Progee-API is a REST API for providing information about programming languages, and frameworks, their popularity, and respect for them among the community of developers (with reviews and scores). 
Currently working features: **languages, frameworks, reviews**.

## API docs

Documentation for the Progee API is available at Postman Documenter: [See docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14256972/UzBgwAPQ)

## Database realtions map

Progee API includes 4 main entities: Language (for programming language), Framework (for framework of programming language), AppUser (for user of application) and Review (users' review about programming language).
And here is relations between tables of MySQL database:

## Frontend (Android client)

_Soon._

## Tech stack

This REST API is developed using Java programming language and Spring Boot starter of Spring framework. The full tech stack:

  - **Spring Boot**
  - **MySQL** for Database
  - **Spring Data JPA** for data access layers
  - **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization
  - **JWT** for tokens and share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server
  - **Jakarta Validation API** for for expressing and validating application constraints
  - **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code
  - and etc.

## Usage

**Attention!** This project for some configuration properties (username and password of MySQL, secret key of HMAC256 algorithm used to encode/decode JWT token) uses IntelliJ IDEA environment variables. Define your environtment variables or paste your values directly to places where environment variables are used:

- spring.datasource.username=${MYSQL_USERNAME} at application.properties: line 6
- spring.datasource.password=${MYSQL_PASSWORD} at application.properties: line 7
- System.getenv("MY_JWT_SECRET") at JWTUtils: line 34
